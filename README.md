Rent-A-Car
==========

Rent-A-Car appication, Windows Universal

The user is able to rent a car from list of rent-a-car companies. The companies provide a list of car types to choose from – Sedan, Hatchback, Minivan, etc. After the choice is made the user is presented with a list of vehicles of the selected type.
The cars list displays information about the most important properties of the vehicle – model title, photo, seats and luggage count, air-conditioning capability. 

After selecting a vehicle from the list the user is able to rent it and is navigated to a directional view that helps the user to find the rented car.

The directional view consists of two animated arrows. The grayed one points to the North Pole and the colorful one points to the rented car’s current position. The view also provides information about the distance to the car according to the current user position. The animated directional view updates according to the phone’s pitch and inclination readings.

When the user parks the car at a desired place he/she is able to mark it as “parked” at the current position, enabling him/her to find the car later (sets the car’s position to the current user position).
When the user rents a car it is marked as not available in the system and is not seen by other users willing to rent a car.
